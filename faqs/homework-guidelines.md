### 1. Credit sources to avoid plagiarism

For short answers, if you use others' work as part of your answer, please properly cite your source. While it is fine to use web or other sources as a reference, you are **prohibited from to lift whole paragraphs** from the Internet. This is considered plagiarism, especially when you do not indicate the boundary of the copied content. When you quote a whole sentence or more, please add quotation marks around the copied content and indicate sources, so that we know you did not write that. 

Please refer to the following example for inline citation and bibliography styles. Please use the author-year format for inline citations. 

This phenomenon has been mentioned in several sources include a web page [^1] and a journal paper **(Yeh 1996)**. [^2]

[^1]: "Zen and the Art of the Internet." http://freenet.buffalo.edu/~popmusic/zen10.txt 

[^2]: Yeh, Michelle. "The 'Cult of Poetry' in Contemporary China." Journal  of Asian Studies  55 (1996): 51-80.

### 2. ChatGPT and Generative AI Policy
I expect you to clearly attribute what text/codes were
generated by the AI tool (e.g., AI-generated text appears in a different colored/styled font, quoted
directly in the text, or use an in-text parenthetical citation). Please follow the
    [Chicago citation style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html), such as:

- ChatGPT, response to "*Explain how to make pizza dough from common household ingredients*," (followup promopt to list ingredients; edited for style and content) OpenAI     ChatGPT 3.5, March 7, 2023.

Our specific instructions include:

- please report the **original prompt** you used.
- please indicate whether you have **followup prompts**.
- please indicate whether the ChatGPT/AI output has been **edited for style or content**.

### 3. Submission format

Submit all your answers in acceptable file formats (html, pdf, docx), preferrably in one file. We do not accept ipynb because Canvas does not know how to render it.

On Databricks, you can **export your notebook as HTML** and submit the HTML file.

If your submission includes multiple files, attach them individually (do not zip it).

### 4. How include an image in your submission

If you need to upload a picture, we suggest you to upload the image to a free image hosting site [https://freeimage.host/](https://freeimage.host/), and then copy the **Markdown Full linked** code into a markdown cell (a cell started with `%md`, as shown below, where the second line is coped from freeeimage.host).

### 5. How to take a screenshot
Ocasionally you may need to submit a screenshot. Here are some tips

**Windows** : In windows 7 or above, you may use the built-in **Snipping tool** , which allows you to select an area on screen and capture it. In Windows 10, you may use shortcut "**Win+Shift+S**" to select a screen area to save.

**Mac** : On Mac OS, Press **Command-Shift-4**, and then drag the cross-hair pointer to select the area.
