        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This course provides an introduction to big data concepts, processes, tools, and pipelines from the
            perspective of data science professionals. It uses a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach to develop an
            understanding of major elements of the big data ecosystems and develop hands-on competency with key big data
            tools and processes needed for building/deploying scalable data engineering pipelines and machine learning
            solutions, such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, Cloud Computing, and NoSQL. This course prepares data science
            professionals for using big data tools to harness the power and big data and serve as a first introduction
            to machine learning engineering.</p>
        <p>Because the topics covered in this course are vast and evolving quickly, students are expected to engage in
            active learning through troubleshooting, experimentation, proactive research, and sharing (via Slack).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="kl_custom_block_0" class="">
        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
        <p>This course has two main categories of objectives.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Develop an understanding of the big data ecosystem, the kinds of problems it aims to solve, the
                characteristics of big data technologies, and their key advantages and disadvantages. Such an
                understanding allows you to recognize opportunities and challenges associated with big data, from both
                business and technological perspectives, and to guide businesses in adopting and using big data
                technologies.</li>
            <li>Develop core competencies in a variety of essential big data tools (such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark,
                Snowflake, and Cloud computing) and processes (such as ML pipelines) for solving data science problems
                and deploying business analytics solutions at scale.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>This course is built on a sequence of courses offered in the MSBA program including Python programming (MSBA
            6311) and database management (MSBA 6321). As prerequisites for this course, students are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a basic knowledge of computing systems (operating systems, file systems, conceptual understanding
                of how computers work).</li>
            <li>Be familiar with SQL and relational databases
                <ul>
                    <li>Those who lack knowledge of SQL and relational databases are advised to learn from many

        <h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
        <h4>Homework Academic Integrity</h4>
        <p><strong>All homework assignments are INDIVIDUAL assignments</strong>. Plagiarism is prohibited and will be
            penalized. You may still discuss the homework problems with fellow
            students.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>However, no documents or fragments of homework should be shared between
                students, physically or digitally.</strong> A rule of thumb is that you should have "typed it with your
            own hands".<span>&nbsp;</span>Sharing homework papers is strictly forbidden and is considered plagiarism,
            and both the one who shared and the one who received them can face a penalty, including zero grade for the
            assignment, a letter grade downgrade, and an "F" for the course. All scholarly dishonesty incidence will be
            reported to the University's<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external"
                href="https://communitystandards.umn.edu/address-misconduct/responding-scholastic-dishonesty"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Office of Community Standards</span></a>. In case of difficulty
            with homework assignments, please reach out to the instructor or TA as early as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Reusing someone else's work</strong> (including those from the Internet) without accrediting the
            source properly is also considered plagiarism.<span>&nbsp;</span>You must <strong>cite such work</strong>
            and precisely point out which part of your answer refers to the work and include a reference to the
            source.<span>&nbsp;</span>Refer to our submission guidelines for more homework-related instructions.</p>
        <h4>Late Policy - Flex Days</h4>
        <p><strong>You have 5 flex days</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that you may use at your discretion to defer the due
            date of a homework assignment or self-assessment quizzes (a set of self-assessment quizzes due on the same
            day is considered one "assignment"). You must use your flex days in the whole day (24 hours) increments. You
            can defer a single assignment by<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>a maximum of 2 days</strong>.</p>
        <p>You do not need to notify us if you want to use your flex days on homework or self-assessment quizzes! Submit
            your homework/self-assessment quizzes when ready and the proper number of flex days will be deducted. If you
            do not want to use your flex days on a certain assignment, please let the TA know.</p>
        <p>Flex days are intended to be used for unforeseen circumstances such as technical difficulties, family
            emergencies, and personal illness.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>After your flex days have been used for the
                semester, late work will not be accepted and will earn no credit (0 points)</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Homework Grading</h4>
        <p>Homework assignments are usually graded by TA within one week of the due date. Homework is graded on a scale
            of 0 to 10. If you get 10, you will receive the full 3% credit. If you get 9, you will receive 2.7% credit,
            and so on. The instructor/TA reserves the right to give extra credits for exceptional work.</p>
        <h4>Safeguard Your Work</h4>
        <p>You should always save a copy of your submitted work, including homework, team projects, and the exams. Store
            the copy in a secure location (such as your Google Drive).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="kl_custom_block_4" class="">
        <h3>Team Project - Trend Marketplace</h3>
        <p><span>The team project is evaluated by your peers, the instructor, and external judges. The team project is
                generally evaluated along the lines of value, presentation, rigor, and creativity. While in general
                every team member receives the same credit, those who lack contribution (as reflected by peer evaluation
                within the group) may receive partial to zero credit. For detailed guidelines about team projects,
                please see the team assignment handout.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="kl_custom_block_5" class="">
        <h3>Self-assessment Quizzes</h3>
        <p><span>We allow open notes for self-assessment quizzes but this must be your own work. You cannot collaborate
                with any other individual in any way. That is, there should not be any discussion of the quiz between
                you and others (including those from the Internet) before or during the quiz.</span></p>

        <p><span>Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may be used for any open-book assignment
                (including individual and team assigments and labs, and exams) with appropriate citation. You are

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our general guiding principle is that ChatGPT and generative AI tools can be leveraged to augment learning
            (e.g. aid brainstorming, generate baseline codes, or explaining concepts/logic), but should not subsitute
            learning. For example, you'll be penalized for accepting generic ChatGPT/AI outputs as is without oversight
            or enhancement. To make effective use of ChatGPT/AI tools, you must have fundational knoweldge to be able
            independently evaluate the quality/accuracy of ChatGPT/AI output and improve upon it.</p>

        <h3>In-class Polls</h3>
        We use in-class polls to increase engagement, gauge learning, and audit attendance (by not attending the class,
        you will miss these poll questions). Your in-class poll credit consists of 30% participation and 70%
        performance, where "participation" is defined as the number of polls participated divided by the total number of
        polls conducted, and "performance" is calculated as the number of polls you answered correctly divided by the
        number of polls that has right/wrong answers (opinions polls have no right/wrong answer).
        <h3>Slack Participation</h3>
        <p>To encourage active participation and complement classroom instruction, we have a dedicated
            <strong>#bigdata-news-articles</strong> slack channel for sharing big-data news, articles, and discussions
            of related topics (not associated with an assignment). When you share a post, please try to add your take
            (e.g. what's interesting about the article and why we need to know read it) and provide a link. We encourage
            interactions with other people's posts by liking and/or commenting. A tentative grading scheme is as
            follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a post of at least 20 words in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>#bigdata-news-articles </strong> channel:
                10 points</li>
            <li>a comment of at least 5 words in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>#bigdata-news-articles </strong> channel:
                2 points</li>
            <li>you will receive the full 0.5% slack participation grade if you reach 20 points by the end of the
                semester.</li>
            <li>To encourage spreading your contribution over time, only your <strong>first post</strong> and
                <strong>first 3 comments</strong> on any given day will receive points</li>
            <li>We will take a snapshot of contributions at the end of the semester - later contributions will not be
                considered. I will NOT pre-announce the cut-off date, so please do not wait till the last minute to
                contribute articles and comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The instructor reserves the right to adjust slack participation credits based on subjective evaluation of
            student participation and/or finetune the grading scheme.</p>

        <h3>Modality</h3>
        This course is scheduled as an in-person course. I intend to hold all class sessions in-person except if
        situational factors arise, such as personal illness of the instructor, when the class may be held synchronously

                    <h4>Student Academic Misconduct and Scholastic Dishonesty</h4>
                    <p>The Carlson School defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that misrepresents the
                        student's own academic work or that compromises the academic work of another. Scholastic
                        misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on assignments or examinations,
                        plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one's own work any work done by another, submitting the
                        same paper, or substantially similar papers, to meet the requirement of more than one course
                        without the approval and consent of the instructors concerned, or sabotaging another's work.
                        Within this general definition, however, instructors determine what constitutes academic
                        misconduct in the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct face
                        penalties ranging from lowering of the course grade or awarding a grade of F or N for the entire
                        course, to suspension from the University.</p>

                        opportunities.&nbsp;<br />The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that works
                        with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.
                        Students registered with the DRC, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to
                        contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a
                        disability (e.g. psychiatric, attention, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are
                        invited to contact the DRC for a confidential discussion at 612-626-1333 (V/TTY) or at <a

                    <h4>Students with Mental Health and Stress Management</h4>
                    <p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as
                        strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty
                        concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
                        lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily
                        activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these
                        and other concerns you may be experiencing. Learn more about the broad range of
